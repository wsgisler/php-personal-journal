# What is the theme of this year?

# What does this mean?

# My strengths

# What time wasters do I not want to give into anymore?

# What deep discomfort am I willing to endure regularly to get a payoff later on?

# What are some things that I want to control, but I can't?

# What are some things that I can control, but I haven't so far?

# I want to get better at...

# The work that matters most to me is...

# Some concrete things I will do differently this year

# Long term projects to prioritize

# Daily habits to deepen

# Daily habit to subtract

# Relationships to invest in

# If I manage to do these three things, then my year will be a success
